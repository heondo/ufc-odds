#### Why I made this
I'm not a betting man at all but I've recently been watching a lot of UFC fights and it is so unpredictable. Everyone thinks they are good at predicting sporting events but who really keeps track.

Why not use what I've learned to make this....along with some data gathering along the way.

#### Languages/Frameworks
* Postgres
* NodeJS
* Express
* Styled Components, Axios, Hooks
* React
* CRON jobs to gather/update data on a schedule will have to tweak fights that are more recent so on and so forth, but every sunday morning should be fine.
* Trying out Async/Await, implementing PropTypes, useContext, cookies for JWT
